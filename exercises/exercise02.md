## Instructions

- Answer each question below using SQL executed against the **World database**.
- All SQL commands **must be run by you**.
- For each SQL-based question:
  - Include the SQL command in a fenced code block
  - Include a **screenshot** showing the command and its results
- Store screenshots in the `screenshots/` folder and embed them below each answer.

## Question 1

When importing records from `worldPGSQL.sql`, **how many cities were imported**?

### Answer
_Write the number of cities imported._
4079
### Screenshot
_Show evidence of how you determined this (for example, a COUNT query)._


```sql
-- SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_cities
FROM city;
```

## Question 2

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **display each country name along with the name of each language spoken in that country**.

### SQL

```sql
-- SELECT
    country.Name AS CountryName,
    countrylanguage.Language AS Language
FROM country
JOIN countrylanguage
    ON country.Code = countrylanguage.CountryCode
ORDER BY country.Name, countrylanguage.Language;
```

## Question 3

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **display each country name along with the name of each official language spoken in that country**.

### SQL
SELECT
    country.Name AS CountryName,
    countrylanguage.Language AS OfficialLanguage
FROM country
JOIN countrylanguage
    ON country.Code = countrylanguage.CountryCode
WHERE countrylanguage.IsOfficial = 'T'
ORDER BY country.Name, countrylanguage.Language;

```sql
--
```

## Question 4

Consider the following two SQL statements:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM country, countrylanguage
WHERE country.code = countrylanguage.countrycode;
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM country
LEFT OUTER JOIN countrylanguage
ON country.code = countrylanguage.countrycode;
```

**In your own words**, describe what data the **second query returns that the first query does not**.

### Answer
The second query (the LEFT OUTER JOIN) returns all rows from the country table, including countries that do not have any matching rows in the countrylanguage table.
The first query behaves like an INNER JOIN, so it only returns countries that have at least one matching row in countrylanguage. Any country without a related language record is excluded entirely from the result set.

## Question 5

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **list all different forms of government** found in the data.
Do **not** repeat any form of government more than once.

### SQL

```sql
-- Your SQL here
```
SELECT DISTINCT GovernmentForm
FROM country
ORDER BY GovernmentForm;

## Question 6

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **list all names of cities and countries in one column**.
Label the column **"City or Country Name"**.

### SQL

```sql
-- SELECT Name AS "City or Country Name"
FROM city
UNION
SELECT Name
FROM country
ORDER BY "City or Country Name";

```

## Question 7

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **list all countries by name**, along with the **number of languages spoken in each country**.
Be sure to **sort by country name**.

### SQL

```sql
-- SELECT
    country.Name AS CountryName,
    COUNT(countrylanguage.Language) AS NumberOfLanguages
FROM country
LEFT JOIN countrylanguage
    ON country.Code = countrylanguage.CountryCode
GROUP BY country.Name
ORDER BY country.Name;
```

## Question 8

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **list all languages**, along with the **number of countries where each language is spoken**.
Be sure to **sort by language name**.

### SQL

```sql
-- SELECT
    countrylanguage.Language AS Language,
    COUNT(countrylanguage.CountryCode) AS NumberOfCountries
FROM countrylanguage
GROUP BY countrylanguage.Language
ORDER BY countrylanguage.Language;

```

## Question 9

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **list countries that have more than two official languages**, along with the **number of official languages spoken**.

*Hint: There are 8 such countries in this dataset.*

### SQL

```sql
-- SELECT
    country.Name AS CountryName,
    COUNT(countrylanguage.Language) AS NumberOfOfficialLanguages
FROM country
JOIN countrylanguage
    ON country.Code = countrylanguage.CountryCode
WHERE countrylanguage.IsOfficial = 'T'
GROUP BY country.Name
HAVING COUNT(countrylanguage.Language) > 2
ORDER BY country.Name;
```

## Question 10

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **find cities where the district value is missing**.

*Hint: Use `LIKE` and the dash (`-`) since some rows use that instead of actual data.*

### SQL

```sql
-- SELECT Name, CountryCode, District
FROM city
WHERE district IS NULL
   OR TRIM(district) = ''
   OR TRIM(TRANSLATE(district, '-–', '')) = ''
ORDER BY countrycode, name;

```

## Question 11

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **calculate the percentage of cities with missing district values**.

*Hint: The result should be approximately 0.4%.*

### SQL

```sql
-SELECT
    CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN district IS NULL
	OR TRIM(district) = ''
	OR TRIM(TRANSLATE(district, '-–', '')) = '' THEN 1 END)
	AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) * 100 / COUNT(*)
	AS PercentageMissingDistrict
FROM
    city;
-
```
