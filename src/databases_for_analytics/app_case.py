# === DECLARE IMPORTS (BRING IN FREE CODE) ===

# Python standard library
import logging  # only needed so we can type hint the logger variable
from typing import Final  # only needed for type hinting constants

# External (must be listed in pyproject.toml)
# logging helps track program execution and is preferred over print statements
# We'll use a pre-configured logger that respects privacy.
from datafun_toolkit.logger import (
    get_logger,
    log_header,
)

# === CONFIGURE LOGGER ONCE PER MODULE (PYTHON FILE) ===

# Call the get_logger() function, pass in a phrase and the logging level we want.
# The phrase helps identify the source of log messages.
# The level could be "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", or "CRITICAL".
# Use DEBUG for development, INFO for production.
LOG: logging.Logger = get_logger("P01", level="INFO")

# === DECLARE GLOBAL CONSTANTS ===

# All of these global variables are CONSTANT and do NOT change when the program runs.
# By convention, constant variable names are all UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.
# Declare a variable and initialize it with a value for each of these common types:
#    str, int, float, bool, list of strings.
# Code like a pro: Use optional Python `type hints` to make types explicit
# Just add a colon and the type before the equals sign.
# If a variable is a constant, use Final from typing module.

    This function creates what we call `side effects` -
    it just logs output to the console and a file.

    Use the LOG variable to call info() methods to log messages.
    Call the log_header() function once to log some key details that can help with debugging.
    Call the get_summary() function to get the formatted summary string,
